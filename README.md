# provarviz

Tools for visualising cumalitive changes using pairwise comparisons generated by nucdiff.

Page will be updated with detailed documentation soon.

For the scripts used to generate the figures in the study "Colonizing and infecting subclones diverge during Staphylococcus aureus infection." please goto the mssa-paper branch. n.b. These scripts contain a lot of hardcoded information specific to the project and as should only be used to reproduce the initial study.
